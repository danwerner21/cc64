\ This is a variant of the X16 implementation x16tmpheap.fth
\ which places all the code for the tmpheap onto the heap,
\ just like the transient 6502 assembler trns6502asm.fth.
\ So after a SAVE or CLEAR, the tmpheap code is all gone, which is
\ nice since the compiled turnkey application will likely not need
\ it anymore, and so the compile time space saving that tmpheap offers
\ comes at zero cost in turnkey application size.
